In a 22nd-century Earth ravaged by blight and dust storms, former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper joins a mission to find a habitable planet through a wormhole near Saturn.  The mission, involving a perilous journey to planets near a black hole, is humanity's last hope for survival.  Cooper leaves his children, promising to return, but experiences extreme time dilation, aging far less than those on Earth.  The mission faces betrayal, death, and impossible odds, culminating in Cooper's fall into a black hole and his unexpected interaction with his daughter through time, providing her the key to solving a crucial equation that will allow humanity's escape from Earth.  Ultimately, he is rescued and reunites with his daughter before joining the new colony on a distant planet.
