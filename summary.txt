This is a summary of *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*.  The story begins with a prologue detailing the mysterious deaths of the Riddle family fifty years prior, witnessed by their gardener, Frank Bryce, who also saw a mysterious dark-haired boy.  Frank is later murdered by Lord Voldemort and his servant, Peter Pettigrew ("Wormtail"), who are revealed to be plotting against Harry Potter.

Harry, now fourteen, wakes with a painful scar and a disturbing dream involving Voldemort and Wormtail, who discuss killing someone (and using another wizard as a substitute if capturing Harry proves too difficult).  Harry writes to his godfather, Sirius Black, who is in hiding after escaping Azkaban.

The Dursleys receive a letter from Mrs. Weasley inviting Harry to the Quidditch World Cup and stay at the Burrow.  After a chaotic arrival of the Weasleys (via Floo Powder, resulting in a destroyed fireplace), Harry departs with the family.

The Weasleys explain that large gatherings of wizards require special travel methods to avoid Muggle detection.  They travel to the Quidditch World Cup via a Portkey â€“ a magically enchanted object (in this case, a moldy boot) that transports them instantly.  Along the way, Dudley is accidentally affected by Fred and George's Ton-Tongue Toffees.  The chapter ends with their arrival at the World Cup site.
