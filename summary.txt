This HTML code creates a simple contact form.  The form, titled "Contact Form," uses the POST method to send data to "/submit". It requires users to input their name and email address using text fields with appropriate labels and input types (`text` and `email`).  A submit button allows users to send the form data.  The `required` attribute ensures both fields must be completed before submission.
