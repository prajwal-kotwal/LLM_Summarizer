His seemingly ordinary life is disrupted when he learns he's a wizard.  On his eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, the gamekeeper of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reveals Harry's magical heritage and that his parents were killed by the dark wizard Voldemort, who also attempted to kill Harry as a baby, leaving him with a lightning-shaped scar.\n",

Harry excels at Quidditch, becoming the youngest Seeker in a century, despite facing challenges from Draco Malfoy and his cronies, who constantly taunt him.  Throughout the year, Harry, along with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, unravels a mystery surrounding the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary object capable of granting immortality and transmuting metals into gold.\n",

Harry discovers that his mother's love protected him from Voldemort's touch, allowing him to ultimately defeat Quirrell and prevent Voldemort from obtaining the Stone.  The Stone is destroyed, and Harry returns home for the summer, triumphant and forever changed.  Gryffindor wins the house cup due to Dumbledore awarding last-minute points for bravery and loyalty.\n",
