      "Four computer science students at Graphic Era Deemed-to-be University completed a synopsis for their Bachelor of Technology thesis on an AI-powered text summarizer using Large Language Models (LLMs).  Their project aims to address the challenges of information overload by creating a high-quality, context-aware summarizer.  The project will explore both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques, including TextRank, LexRank, transformer models, and pointer-generator networks, potentially using a hybrid approach.  The summarizer will incorporate personalization features and be evaluated using ROUGE scores and user feedback.  The synopsis details the project's objectives, hardware/software requirements, and a literature review of existing LLM-based summarization techniques.\n",
